		<h4><p>We have noticed a growing need for proper guidance in the integration process,
		because we have not found websites that help find local people who are willing to help the people in need,
		we decided to take things in our own hands. We made this website to make people communicate more with say immigrants.
		For now, we focus on the city Rotterdam and the surrounding towns, but later we want to make this website global, 
		to connect all people in the world.</p></h4>
