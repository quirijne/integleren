	<h1>What is the Netherlands</h1>
	<hr>  
<p>
We in the Netherlands are very direct, people say exactly what they are thinking. 
So, situations can arise where you may think we Dutch are very mean but often people are trying to help you. 
How you can make sure you are heard is by also being very direct, just make sure you don't criticize people at inappropriate moments, 
for example at a funeral or a job interview. 
Also, Dutch people will have different humor than other cultures, 
again this is mainly influenced by the directness of the Dutch.

Dutch culture also sometimes highlights our former hierarchy.
 For example with the birthday of our king we celebrate a huge party.
 We do this to give him a kind of tribute. 
 The Dutch villages fill up completely with children on rugs selling all their junk.
 This is something where people can party and get jolly. Again, this is typical Dutch.

Delftware, as the name implies, comes from Delft.
 For years, plates, cups, statues and so on have been smeared with paint,
 but not just any paint, Delft blue paint. These dishes are available in all thrift stores because 
 we Dutch are immensely proud of these cultural works of art. On the plates are usually painted with typical dutch things like windmills, 
 cows, countrysides or canals, so you can also see this as typically Dutch.

Every year Sinterklaas comes to the Netherlands, an old man with a red mitre and a golden staff.
 It has been celebrated for a super long time and is also seen as typically Dutch. 
 If you want to talk about this topic you have to be careful though, 
 right now this holiday is very controversial.
 The discussion is about how Sinterklaas uses 'slaves', the so called 'pieten'. 
 In fact, the 'zwarte pieten' are black and because discrimination is not of our time, 
 people are now trying to end the tradition. Be sure to discuss this topic with people, 
 as this is not a very sensitive topic and will definitely help with learning the Dutch language.

The Dutch used to wear clogs a lot, these are wooden shoes that were mostly worn by the less wealthy people in 1900.
 But because we used to wear this so much you could say that this is typically Dutch.

Also, every big city has a barrel organ on the street corner. 
There will be a man standing by, shaking a collection box to the beat. 
This is also a perfect place to socialize and network in the entertainment industry. 
The barrel organs have also been used since time immemorial, they used to be used in many market squares as well,
so it is also typically Dutch with a rich history.
